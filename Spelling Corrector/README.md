# Spelling Corrector

## Motivation
Checking the spelling of words in the text is the most basic requirement in any text processing/analysis task. Thus, developing a simple language model that checks the correctness of the word's spelling and suggests possible alternatives is a good starting point. 

## Approach
Here, I have built a Bayesian Probabilistic Model using basic python packages and no NLP specific packages. This notebook shows examples where typographical errors are replaced by correct words. The notebook also has detailed description of the models used and the process.
